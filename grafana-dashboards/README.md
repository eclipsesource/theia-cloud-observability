# Grafana Dashboards

Contains an export of the custom Grafana Dasboard for Theiacloud and a utility script to minify it.
The minified JSON is used in [kube-prometheus-stack](../kube-prometheus-stack/manifests) to apply it to the deployed Grafana instance.

There is nothing to do in this folder during setup of the observability check.
