## Repository Classification

This repository contains a demonstrator. It is used to demonstrate a specific feature on a documented demo path. It is not meant to be used in production or as a template. Consequently, the authors do not actively ensure that anything other than the demo path works and don’t plan to support different set-ups or environments. Until stated otherwise, the authors do not intend to apply security fixes, update dependencies, fix issues or provide more documentation. Please feel free to browse the code although it is not meant as a blueprint, i.e. there might be expected and undocumented architectural shortcomings or work around.
Please feel free to report issues, ask questions and raise discussions, but please don’t expect the authors to provide support.

If you are interested in transforming this demonstrator into an adoptable state, please get in contact with us using the [discussions forum](https://github.com/eclipsesource/theia-cloud-observability/discussions) and have a look at our [support options](https://eclipsesource.com/services)!
